# Netflix_Content_Analysis
This project analyzes the Netflix content library (8,000+ titles) to identify how the streaming giant has shifted its strategy between 2008 and 2021. Using Tableau, I transformed raw metadata into an interactive executive dashboard to visualize global production trends, genre dominance, and the transition from Movies to TV Shows.
